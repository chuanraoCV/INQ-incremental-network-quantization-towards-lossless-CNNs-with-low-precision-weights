Python / Matlab versions

I will describe the layout of the Python version of the dataset. The layout of the Matlab version is identical. 

The archive contains the files data_batch_1, data_batch_2, ..., data_batch_5, as well as test_batch. Each of these files is a Python "pickled" object produced with cPickle. Here is a python2 routine which will open such a file and return a dictionary:
def unpickle(file):
    import cPickle
    with open(file, 'rb') as fo:
        dict = cPickle.load(fo)
    return dict
And a python3 version:
def unpickle(file):
    import pickle
    with open(file, 'rb') as fo:
        dict = pickle.load(fo, encoding='bytes')
    return dict
Loaded in this way, each of the batch files contains a dictionary with the following elements:
data -- a 10000x3072 numpy array of uint8s. Each row of the array stores a 32x32 colour image. The first 1024 entries contain the red channel values, the next 1024 the green, and the final 1024 the blue. The image is stored in row-major order, so that the first 32 entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image.
labels -- a list of 10000 numbers in the range 0-9. The number at index i indicates the label of the ith image in the array data.

The dataset contains another file, called batches.meta. It too contains a Python dictionary object. It has the following entries:
label_names -- a 10-element list which gives meaningful names to the numeric labels in the labels array described above. For example, label_names[0] == "airplane", label_names[1] == "automobile", etc.
